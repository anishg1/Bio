## <u>Experience</u>

- [**Walmart Global Tech India, Bengaluru**]([_Walmart Global Tech India_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/walmartglobaltechindia/mycompany/))
  > Data Scientist 
  >> Jun, 2021 - Present </br>
  >> Skills : PySpark, Python, Explainable AI, Time Series Forecasting, 
Deep Learning, Product Development
    - Involved in the development and deployment of multiple 
    <green>**business KPIs' (Markdown, Markup etc.)**</green> forecasting frameworks. 
    Due to the erratic nature of the time series data a lot of experimentation 
    was involved and finally we were able to reach the accuracy which was 
    justifiable for business in order to <green>**execute efficient business planning 
    for the next quarter in terms of monitoring the mentioned KPIs and 
    eventually retail stores revenue**</green>.
    - Developed a framework for Supply-Chain business to help with their labour 
    planning. The problem was to monitor a business KPI called CPH (Cases Per Hour) 
    and explain the impact of different business metrics on CPH. The framework 
    involved <green>**CPH prediction (with XGBoost) with an XAI (Explainable AI) layer**</green> 
    which helped business quantify the impact of different factors on CPH.
    - Involved in the development of <">**Zero Intermittent Sales Forecasting**</green> for a 
    separate entity within Walmart using 
    <green>**Time Series Characterization and LSTM**</green>.
